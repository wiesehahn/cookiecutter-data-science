## `docs`

This folder is used by Github for 'Github Pages', which is the project website.

GitHub Pages will read the contents of your /docs directory, convert the index.md into HTML, and publish the results at your GitHub Pages URL under []({{cookiecutter.user_name}}.github.io/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/)

Alternatively a HTML file (`index.html`) located here can also serve as project website.
